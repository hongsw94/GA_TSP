# GA_TSP

## Genetic Algorithm Implemented (Drilling PCB)

## Genetic Algorithm from scratch

If you just want to check out the results please check `practice.ipynb`. There are some trial and errors included (e.g., Edge Recombination Crossover)

If running, just run (only numpy and matplotlib is required)
```
python main.py
```

### 1. Problem

Download TSP problem (PCB drilling problem)

The PCB drilling problem is to drill a PCB with minimizing

### 2. Problem Formulation using Genetic Algorithm Setups

- Main steps of Genetic Algorithm 
    1. Evaluation : Evaluate the solution (by Euclidean distance) 
    2. Selection : Tournamanent Selection 
    3. Crossover : Cyclic Crossover 
    4. Mutation : displacement mutation
